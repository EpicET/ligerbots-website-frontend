## How to install.

- Download from repo.
- Install pnpm (a better npm) - `npm install -g pnpm`
- `cd {REPO_HOME}`
- `pnpm install`
- Copy `.env-example` to `.env` and update the following entries with values Rob will provide you in slack:
  - `API_URL`
  - `API_USERNAME`
  - `API_PASSWORD`

With any luck, you should be able to run a copy of the new website locally.

To start the server, type `npm run dev`
